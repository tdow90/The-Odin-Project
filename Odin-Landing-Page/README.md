# Landing-Page

I attempted to follow the landing page spec as closely as I could. I admit, my interests are much more towards the back end. I plan 
to use frameworks for all front end as I dont have a big interest to design websites. Notes in the commits, I did swtich from building all the css myself to using bootstrap, which gave the final look.
