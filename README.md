# Odin-Project

This repo contains the work I did as I worked through the ODIN PROJECT. I started off wanting to follow the Full stack ruby on rails path. But I found that the additional material was lacking for ruby. So I pivoted to python, which I found easier to learn. I continued on with the leasons, trying to tailor them for Python. I also went through the Web Programming with Pythong and JS cs50 course on EdEx. 

I tried to cover all the material covered in the odin project, but prefered learning python.
