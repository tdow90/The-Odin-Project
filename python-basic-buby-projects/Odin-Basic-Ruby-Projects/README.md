# Odin-Basic-Ruby-Projects

I wanted to continue with the odin project, but instead of using Ruby i am going to use Python/Django. I will be going through and learning all the concerpt in the Odin Project, but I will also be going through CS50 introduction t o web developement with JS and Pythong. I hope to be able to complete everything in the odin Project, but with Python vs Ruby. 

This is the "Basic Ruby Projects" but complted in python.
